Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.


1.Who was the client? 

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security.


2.What issue did they want you to address? 

The issue they want Global Rain to solved is to help secure their client data and financial information by adding a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. As a part of the Global Rain team, I needed to help complete a data verification step in the form of a checksum. We will add secure communication mechanisms to their current software application. Global Rain team will deliver a production quality integrated application that will meet their software security requirements by having a secure coding protocols for Artemis Financial system.


3.What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? 

I believe that I did well in identifying the manual review of the Artemis Financial code when searching for the security vulnerabilities.


4.Why is it important to code securely? 

It is important to detect security vulnerabilities in order to protect the software from attacks on the data.


5.What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? 

The value of software security is to protect the user data and lowering the security risks.


6.What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful? 

The most challenging part of working through the vulnerability assessment diagram was learning how to suppress false positives.


7.How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? 

There were various approaches that I took to increase the layers of security and by refactored the code to incorporate Https which is more secure than Http.


8.What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques? 

Ensuring that the software is secure, by keeps the application productive in the future by calculating the vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques.


9.How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? 

Ensuring that the application was functional and secure by testing the functionality, running a new dependency check and a static test. Also, check regularly to see if there are any available updates to the dependencies.


10.After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 

When checking for vulnerabilities, I ran the application before and after the making changes. Performed a static test that allowed me to see if there were any new vulnerabilities were created during the code.


11.What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks? 

The tool used to check for vulnerabilities was the Maven dependency checker tool to detect the vulnerabilities which was very helpful and will continue to be very useful resource when referring to dependencies in the future.


12.What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer? 

When displaying this assignment for an employer, I would want to showcase my experience with suppressing false positives, identifying vulnerabilities and creating a secure Https application. By showcasing my experience and skills from this project will help show future employers that I’m easy to understand and follow.
